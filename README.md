# Creating a hex sticker for the `R2ucare` package

After reading [this excellent post](https://zhuhao.org/post/tips-on-designing-a-hex-sticker-for-rstats-packages/) by Hao Zhu giving tips on designing hex stickers for #rstats packages, I thought I'd give it a try. 

This repo contains my attempts to design a hex sticker for the `R2ucare` package. I'm using the [hexSticker package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker/).
